Here’s a focused review of the Rust crate in this folder (Cargo.toml, README/AGENTS specs, src/core/, src/tech/). I’ve concentrated on critical decision points, current behavior, and risks (with suggested mitigations).

High-level observations
•  Scope mismatch: README specifies a full CLI (commands for new/develop/save/status/input/box/web), extra tech modules (fs, identifier), and visualization, but the codebase currently provides a library with core and tech building blocks (no src/main.rs/CLI or web modules). Several functions are stubs. This is the biggest product risk: expectations vs. shipped behavior.

Critical decision points
1) Archive creation/reading and extraction model
•  Decision: Use ZIP as the archive format with meta/manifest/input.map; load metadata lazily via OnceCell + ZipArchive under a Mutex for thread-safety.
•  Very good: Path traversal defenses exist in extract_file and extract_all and a defensive layout module clarifies the structure.
•  Gap/risk: extract_dir/extract_all don’t canonicalize the final destination path per file before writing, so symlink traversal via pre-existing symlinks under the destination directory is still possible.
•  Suggestion: For every extracted file, canonicalize its parent after ensuring it exists and verify it’s still under the canonicalized dest_dir; avoid following symlinks (or fail on symlinked components). Mirror the stricter extract_file approach.

2) Content identity and hashing
•  Decision: Use SHA-512 in a netstring-like scheme for bytes/files; README also implies deterministic aggregation across files.
•  Gaps/risks:
•  securehash::hash_file asserts bytes_read == file_size; this can panic if files change during read or in edge cases. Panics here are undesirable.
•  Archive::content_id returns a dummy content ID; manifest writing is a TODO; Box.store writes an empty file (not a real ZIP). This breaks invariants required by consumers.
•  Aggregating content IDs doesn’t specify sorted order or path normalization. Without sorting and normalization (e.g., forward slashes), content IDs can become non-deterministic across platforms or file orderings.
•  Suggestions:
•  Replace assert with a Result error if bytes_read != file_size; compute prefix/suffix using the actual bytes hashed if you want robustness.
•  Implement manifest hashing (code + data) with a stable, normalized path ordering (e.g., sorted, forward slashes).
•  Implement Archive::content_id properly (use manifest-derived ID) and write a real ZIP in Box.store/Archive.create.

3) Metadata and compatibility
•  Decision: Fixed meta_version, JSON-based metadata, timestamp format with microseconds, .xmeta sidecar cache.
•  Gaps/risks:
•  Persistence writes are not atomic; a crash mid-write could corrupt metadata. For compatibility with other implementations (e.g., Python), key ordering and ASCII-only are mentioned in README but not enforced (serde_json::to_string_pretty won’t sort keys).
•  .xmeta cache is read but never populated; save_cache only writes if cache is non-empty.
•  Suggestions:
•  Use atomic writes (write to tmp, fsync, rename) for meta/input.map/.xmeta.
•  If cross-impl byte-identical JSON is required, enforce deterministic ordering (e.g., collect to BTreeMap or serialize with a sorted-keys serializer) and ASCII encoding if needed.
•  Actually populate cache entries (e.g., cached meta/content_id/inputs) and validate freshness (mtime checks).

4) Bead trait and type boundaries
•  Decision: Introduce a Bead trait (for archives and workspaces).
•  Gaps/risks:
•  has_input() is a placeholder returning false. The trait isn’t implemented for Archive/Workspace. This undermines the uniform abstraction.
•  Suggestions:
•  Implement Bead for both Workspace and Archive (backed by the actual structures), and provide a correct has_input implementation based on available metadata or typed wrappers.

5) Workspace lifecycle and immutability choices
•  Decisions:
•  Workspace structure: input/, output/, temp/, .bead-meta/, with input made read-only on Unix.
•  Input management (Input struct) loads data to input/<nick> and sets read-only.
•  Risks:
•  On Windows, deleting read-only directories fails unless attributes are cleared; unload/delete handle Unix permissions only.
•  Suggestions:
•  Add Windows permission handling (remove readonly attribute) before deletion to make unload/delete robust cross-platform.

6) Timestamp parsing/format
•  Decision: Custom parsing via slicing and chrono FixedOffset.
•  Risks:
•  Parsing accepts invalid hour/minute by defaulting to 0 (unwrap_or(0)), silently “fixing” malformed timestamps.
•  Suggestions:
•  Validate the timezone substring strictly (must be ±ZZZZ), and return an error on parse failures.

7) Regex/filename conventions for bead archives
•  Decision: Parse name from “{name}_{timestamp}.zip” via regex.
•  Risks:
•  The regex is permissive (r"^(.+?)_\d{8}T[\d+-]+.zip$") and can match unexpected forms. This is probably OK but be aware it tolerates odd suffixes after T.
•  Suggestion:
•  Align parser with the exact timestamp grammar you enforce (e.g., YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSNNNNNN±ZZZZ), and provide unit tests for edge names.

8) Glob/Unicode paths
•  Decision: box_store uses glob and to_str().unwrap().
•  Risk:
•  to_str().unwrap() can panic on non-UTF-8 paths. While rare on macOS, still better to handle gracefully.
•  Suggestion:
•  Return a structured error instead of unwrap(), or filter out non-UTF-8 entries.

9) Security posture beyond traversal
•  Risks:
•  ZIP bombs/oversized entries could exhaust disk/memory; there’s no size limit or quota enforcement.
•  No signature/attestation check on archives (if required in your threat model).
•  Suggestions:
•  Enforce per-file and total extracted size limits, and optionally a max file count.
•  If integrity beyond hashes is desired, design a signing/verification step for archives.

10) Platform specifics and filesystem semantics
•  Decisions:
•  Normalize archive paths to forward slashes; set read-only perms on Unix paths in a few places.
•  Risks:
•  Case-insensitive FS on macOS can affect name collisions; no explicit handling is present (README mentions it).
•  Suggestions:
•  On case-insensitive systems, detect/deny collisions that differ only by case when packaging/extracting.

11) Testing posture
•  Positives:
•  Solid unit tests across archive extraction, workspace lifecycle, timestamp parsing, hashing, box name parsing.
•  Gaps:
•  No integration tests for a full “create workspace -> write code/data -> save archive -> reopen -> extract” happy path.
•  Suggestions:
•  Add end-to-end tests that create a real archive with code+data, write a manifest, compute a stable content_id, and verify round-trip.

Priority risks to address (shortlist)
•  P1: Incomplete core features
•  Archive::content_id is a stub; manifest not implemented; Box.store creates empty files. This blocks correctness for real usage.
•  P1: Extraction symlink traversal (extract_dir/extract_all)
•  Introduce canonicalization checks per extracted file to avoid writing outside dest_dir via pre-existing symlinks.
•  P2: Hashing correctness/usability
•  Remove assert in hash_file; make hashing robust to file changes and ensure deterministic ordering and normalized paths for aggregated content IDs.
•  P2: Cross-platform deletion of read-only inputs
•  Add Windows-compatible attribute handling before deletion.
•  P3: Persistence durability/compatibility
•  Use atomic writes; if Python parity is mandated, ensure deterministic JSON key ordering and encoding.

Smaller issues and cleanups
•  Implement Bead trait for Archive/Workspace and fix has_input.
•  Tighten timestamp parsing; align name regex with timestamp grammar.
•  Handle non-UTF-8 paths in glob iteration gracefully.
•  Wire .xmeta cache reads/writes to be useful, or remove until needed.
•  Add CLI (or adjust README to reflect a library-only crate) to avoid expectations mismatch.
•  Consider size limits to mitigate zip bombs.
•  Consider PoisonError handling for the mutex lock instead of unwrap().

If you want, I can:
•  Draft changes for symlink-safe extraction in extract_dir/extract_all.
•  Implement manifest generation and stable content_id computation (sorted, normalized paths).
•  Replace hash_file assert with error handling and atomic JSON writes.
•  Add Windows attribute handling for unload/delete.
•  Introduce end-to-end tests and wire the Bead trait for Archive/Workspace.
